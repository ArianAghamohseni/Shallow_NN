**Shallow NN :**
Neural Network for Binary Classification

**Description:**
This repository contains a simple implementation of a shallow neural network for binary classification using Python and NumPy. The neural network is trained to learn a decision boundary for classifying data points into one of two classes. The project includes the following components:

- `data_generation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for generating synthetic data for training and testing the neural network.

- `neural_network.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that implements the neural network model, including initialization, forward propagation, cost computation, backward propagation, and training loop.

- `utils.py`: Python module containing utility functions used in the project.

- `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python packages and their versions.

**Key Features:**
- Shallow neural network with one hidden layer.
- Sigmoid activation function.
- Cross-entropy cost function.
- Gradient descent for optimization.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks to understand the data generation and neural network training process.

**Usage:**
- Use the provided Jupyter Notebook to train and test the neural network with your own dataset.
- Visualize the decision boundary learned by the network.
